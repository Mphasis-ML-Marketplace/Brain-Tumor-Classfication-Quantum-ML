# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Quantum-ML
This solution provides a hybrid classical-quantum trainable ML pipeline for brain tumor classification using brain MRI images.


## Product Overview
Brain Tumor Classification solution helps to detect type of brain tumor (glioma, meningioma, and pituitary) in brain MRI images. This solution provides pretrained hybrid classical-quantum model that is built on open source [brain MRI data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) of 7022 images. The solution has trainable pipeline that allows user to bring data to finetune the model to achieve required performance. Usage of qunatum circuit along with Neural network architecture helpes to achieve robust model performance and boost tumor detection with less tagged data. 

## Product Highlight 

* The solution utilizes hybrid classical-quantum architecture to build the model which provides an advantage in the learning process. This advantage arises from the quantum representation of data, and efficient feature extraction. By harnessing quantum capabilities in combination with classical techniques, this hybrid model achieves higher accuracy and robustness on user provided data.
* The solution used open source MRI data from Kaggle to build the pretrained model. The dataset consists of images of three types of tumors (glioma, meningioma, and pituitary) and some no tumor images. The pretraining process reduces requirement of large amounts of user data to build the model. The solution also supports user specified tumor classification schema. The solution triggers finetuning process using user provided images of tumors along with training parameters and configurations as described in udage information.
